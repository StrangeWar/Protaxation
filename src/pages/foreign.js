     <p className="main-head">Foreign Tax Credit</p>
      <hr/>
      <p className="subtext">There are three ways U.S. expats can avoid double taxation while abroad on a foreign assignment: The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion; the Foreign Housing Exclusion- (if employed) or/ and the Foreign Housing Deduction – (if self-employed); all found on Form 2555- Foreign Earned Income and the Foreign Tax Credit found in IRC Sec 901 and on Form 1116- Foreign tax Credit.</p><br/>
      <p className="head">Credit or Deduction</p>
      <p className="subtext">Instead of claiming a credit for eligible foreign taxes, you can choose to deduct foreign income taxes. Form 1040 filers choosing to do so would deduct foreign income taxes on Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions. Generally, if you take the credit for any eligible foreign taxes, you cannot take any part of that year’s foreign taxes as a deduction.</p><br/>
      <p className="head">Foreign Taxes Eligible for a Credit</p>
      <p className="subtext">You can take a credit for income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued during your tax year to any foreign country or U.S. possession, or any political subdivision (for example, city, state, or province) of the country or possession. This includes taxes paid or accrued in lieu of a foreign or possession income, war profits, or excess profits tax that is otherwise generally imposed.</p><br/>
      <p className="head">Foreign Taxes Not Eligible for a Credit</p>
      <p className="subtext">You cannot take a credit for the following foreign taxes paid to a foreign country that you do not legally owe, including amounts eligible for refund by the foreign country. If you do not exercise your available remedies to reduce the amount of foreign tax to what you legally owe, a credit for the excess amount is not allowed. The amount of tax actually withheld by a foreign country is not necessarily 100% creditable.</p><br/>
      <p className="head">Foreign Country Defined</p>
      <p className="subtext">A ‘foreign country’ for the purposes of the Foreign Tax Credit, IRC Sec 901 is defined as any territory under the sovereignty of a government other than the United States. In this instance ‘foreign country’ tax and income are defined as a foreign country or a U.S. possession.
<br/><br/>
A foreign country includes any foreign state and its political subdivisions. A foreign city or province qualify. A U.S. possession includes Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Soma.<br/><br/></p>
