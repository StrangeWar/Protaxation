    <p className="subtext">Under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Sec. 7701(b), Definition of Resident Alien and Nonresident alien, arises Form 1040NR, U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return, which is the tax form used by nonresident aliens to file their individual U.S. income taxes.</p><br/>
    <p className="head">Other interesting features- Form 1040NR</p>
    <p className='subtext'>U.S. nonresident aliens filing Form 1040NR cannot use the standard deduction nor all the itemized deductions afforded to U.S. resident aliens, nor can they file jointly if married.</p>
    <p className='subtext'>Additionally, the claiming of exemptions for dependents by nonresident aliens is much more difficult.</p><br/>
    <p className='head'>Consequences of Filing as a U.S. Nonresident Alien</p>
    <p className='subtext'>U.S. nonresident aliens are taxed in the U.S., only on their U.S. source income. The source of the income depends on the type of income. A basic taxation premise is that the country of income source maintains the first right of taxation related to that income. However income tax treaties usually seek to have such income taxed in the country of residence (and not the source country) to avoid a double filing compliance obligation.</p><br/>
    <p className='head'>Who must File Form 1040NR</p>
    <p className='subtext'>File Form 1040NR if any of the following four conditions applies to you:
<br/><br/>
1. You were a nonresident alien engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the tax year. You must file even if:
<br/><br/>
a. You have no income from a trade or business conducted in the United States,
<br/><br/>
b. You have no U.S. source income, or
<br/><br/>
c. Your income is exempt from U.S. tax under a tax treaty or any section of the Internal Revenue Code.
<br/><br/>
However, if you have no gross income, do not complete the schedules for Form 1040NR. Instead, attach a list of the kinds of exclusions you claim and the amount of each.
<br/><br/>
2. You were a nonresident alien not engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the tax year and:

b. Not all of the U.S. tax that you owe was withheld from that income.
